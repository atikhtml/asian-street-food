      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="about-website">
        Street food refers to food or drinks sold by a hawker or vendor on a
        street or at other public places, such as markets, fairs, and parks. It
        is often sold from a portable food booth, food cart, or food truck and
        is meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but
        many have spread beyond their regions of origin. Most street foods are
        classified as both finger food and fast food and are typically cheaper
        than restaurant meals. The types of street food vary between regions and
        cultures in different countries around the world. According to a 2007
        study from the Food and Agriculture Organization, 2.5 billion people eat
        street food every day. While some cultures consider it to be rude to
        walk on the street while eating, a majority of middle- to high-income
        consumers rely on the quick access and cheap service of street food for
        daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in developing
        countries. Today, governments and other organizations are increasingly
        concerned with both the socioeconomic importance of street food and its
        associated risks. These risks include food safety, sanitation, illegal
        use of public or private areas, social problems, and traffic congestion.

        Siomay is an Indonesian dish consisting of steamed cone-shaped fish
        dumplings, eggs, potatoes, cabbage, tofu, and bitter melon. After they
        have been steamed, all ingredients are assembled on a plate, cut into
        bite-sized pieces, and generously drizzled with a spicy peanut sauce.

        One of the most famous snacks in Indonesia is batagor, a fried fish
        dumpling served in a traditional spicy sauce. It has roots in the
        Chinese culinary tradition, which has left a trace on many Indonesian
        dishes. Although this famous snack is reminiscent of the more famous
        Chinese dumpling, its distinguishable characteristic is that it is
        fried, not steamed.

        The pan-fried variety of the Chinese jiaozi dumpling, known as guotie,
        is a Northern Chinese dumpling typically filled with minced pork,
        Chinese cabbage, scallions, ginger, rice wine, and sesame seed oil.
        Crunchy and soft textures are achieved by a special method of preparing;
        while the bottom of the dumpling is frying, a small amount of liquid is
        added to the pan which is then covered, thus allowing the rest of the
        dumpling and the filling to steam.

        Roti canai is a traditional pan-fried flatbread made with flour, water,
        eggs, and fat of Indian origin, but mainly associated with Malaysia, and
        surrounding countries like Indonesia, Brunei, and Thailand. The dough
        for roti canai is repeatedly folded, so the final product has a layered
        texture, a soft interior, and a crispy outer layer.

        />

        Bánh mì (pronounced 'bun mee') is a popular Vietnamese variety of
        sandwiches that share the same core ingredient - a baguette. The
        baguette was brought over to Vietnam during the colonial period, and
        nowadays it is one of the few happy legacies from the time. The crusty
        bread, condiments, and meats are all a legacy of French and Chinese
        colonialism, while cilantro, chili, and pickles reflect the Vietnamese
        taste for fresh vegetables and bright flavors. In the beginning, most
        banh mi sandwiches consisted of bread, meat, and seasonings, with no
        added vegetables.

        Turkish ice cream is believed to originate from the city of Maraş hence
        the name and what really sets it apart from other varieties is its
        resistance to melting and a particularly dense, chewy texture. These
        qualities are brought by adding two thickening agents to the basic milk
        and sugar mixture: Arab gum, also known as mastic resin, and salepa type
        of flour made from the root of the early purple orchid.

        Other than chai tea, lassi is perhaps the most internationally
        well-known drink of Indian origin. It refers to a probiotic drink made
        with a blend of dahi (yogurt), water, and spices. Lassi is traditionally
        made with yogurt and water and can be either salty or sweet. Sweet
        versions of lassi are typically flavored with sugar, rosewater, or
        different types of blended fruit like mango, lemon, strawberry, and
        other fruit juices. It's a refreshingly sweet and tart drink that's
        similar in consistency to a milkshake.

        Chaat is the most popular type of Indian street food. The term refers to
        a family of savory Indian snacks, some of the most popular being
        samosas, kachori, dahi vadas, vada pav, and pav bhaji. To be honest, I
        find the concept of chaat confusing because the dishes can sometimes
        look so different. Based on its definition, it refers to Indian street
        foods made with a crisp starchy base like fried dough or crispy puffed
        rice. There are many different types of chaat made with a variety of
        additional ingredients, but the common denominator is the crisp starchy
        base.

        spices. It's strongly associated with the beaches of Mumbai, like
        Chowpatty, where it's often enjoyed and referred to as a “beach snack”.
        Bhel puri can be served either wet (gaela bhel) or dry (sukha bel). Wet
        bhel puri is made with the addition of chutneys like tamarind chutney or
        green coriander chutney, but the base ingredients remain the same. It’s
        a crunchy and fun snack with an interesting mix of savory, sweet, sour,
        and spicy flavors.

        green chili, onions, chickpeas, and potato mash. It's popular throughout

        shaped like a round flattened ball (similar to aloo tikki) filled with a
        stuffing. Depending on where it's from, fillings can vary but common
        stuffing ingredients include yellow moong dal, urad dal, besan (gram
        flour), black pepper, chili powder, cumin, and other spices. From what I
        understand, kachori is usually savory but it can also be sweet.

        eaten for breakfast or as a snack. To prepare, lentils and rice are
        soaked for several hours before being ground separately to a fine
        consistency. They’re then seasoned with salt and allowed to ferment
        overnight. When ready, the batter is poured onto a cast-iron pan or
        skillet and cooked like a crepe till golden brown and crispy.

        The kebab is a hugely popular dish that's consumed in many parts of the
        world, including India. It refers to grilled meat dishes skewered on
        metal or bamboo sticks. Traditionally, they're made with mutton or lamb
        but they can be made with other proteins as well like chicken, beef,
        goat, and fish. In India, the origin of modern-day kebabs can be traced
        back to the kitchens of the Mughal Empire. Indian kebabs can be made
        with skewered cubed meat (shish kebab) or ground meat (seekh kebab)
        that's heavily seasoned with Indian spices.

        Pakora refers to a type of spiced fritter made with a variety of
        ingredients, usually vegetables, coated in seasoned gram flour batter
        and then deep-fried. They’re usually eaten as a snack or appetizer with
        tamarind sauce, chutney, or raita. Some of the most common ingredients
        used to make pakoras include onions, potatoes, plantains, paneer (Indian
        cottage cheese), and green chilies, though they can be made with animal
        proteins like meat and fish as well.

        Pav bhaji was one of my favorite street foods in India. Its a simple
        dish but its comforting and absolutely delicious. Pav bhaji is
        originally from Mumbai where it was invented as a quick lunchtime dish
        for the citys textile mill workers in the 1850s. The dish caught on and
        started appearing on restaurant menus in Mumbai and throughout the
        country. Pav bhaji consists of a thick spiced curry made with potatoes
        and vegetables like onions, peas, bell peppers, and tomatoes. The
        potatoes and vegetables are cooked with spices before being mashed and
        served with a soft buttery bread roll. Pav means “bread roll” while
        bhaji refers to vegetables or vegetable-based dishes.
